This Master thesis presents a comprehensive treatment of learning stochastic differential equations from temporal snapshots rather than complete trajectories.

**Key Contributions:**
- Establishes connections between trajectory inference and entropic optimal transport as a convex optimization problem
- Proves identifiability of drift and diffusion parameters under conditions excluding generalized rotational symmetries
- Demonstrates recovery of causal graphs from SDE parameters with additive diffusion
- Introduces APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from X0), an iterative algorithm for parameter estimation
- Validates the approach on simulated linear additive noise SDE data

**Applications:** Gene regulatory networks, contaminant transport modeling, financial markets, and image generation.
