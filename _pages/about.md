## Research Experience

- **Research Assistant**, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada (Sep 2023 - Present)
  - Working on master's research focused on discovering Gene Regulatory Networks using Causal Discovery and Optimal Transport under the supervision of [Prof. Elina Robeva](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~erobeva/index.html).

- **Research Assistant**, Data Science & Machine Learning Lab ([DML](https://dml.ir/)), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran (Jul 2022 - Jan 2023)
  - Worked on Target Domain Augmentation in a human video project, using Normalization Flow techniques like MoGlow for human motion synthesis under the supervision of [Prof. Hamid R. Rabiee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrabiee/).

- **Research Assistant**, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran (Jun 2022 - Oct 2022)
  - Explored the intersection of Deep Learning and Optimization, studying the Implicit Bias of optimization algorithms and their generalization under the supervision of [Prof. Mojtaba Tefagh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mtefagh/).

## Work Experience

- **Data Scientist & Intern**, [Shomara](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shomara/about/), Tehran, Iran (Dec 2021 - Oct 2022)
  - Worked under the supervision of [Prof. Mir-Omid Haji-Mirsadeghi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mir-omid-haji-mirsadeghi-563053161/)
  - Worked on prediction of purchase surplus and Heterogeneous Treatment Effects when people got credit using Causality methods like GRF with a novel type of experiment.
  - Developed a way to estimate the probability of defaulting (in case people won't pay off money) in high variance setting using XGBoost and reduced the variance by CUPED method.

- **Junior Data Scientist**, [Snapp Market](https://www.linkedin.com/company/snappmarket/), Tehran, Iran (Sep 2021 - Dec 2021)
  - Implemented tracking and feature extraction of Computer Vision project about tracking staff and finding a map of the market using YOLO Algorithm, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn.
  - Built a weekly dashboard for showing marketing statistics from Snapp's database using SQL.

- **Data Science Internship**, [Zarrin Roya](https://www.linkedin.com/company/zarrin-group/), Tehran, Iran (Aug 2021 - Nov 2021)
  - Used Regression Algorithms for analyzing trends in business and did statistical tests for Trend detection based on the Mann-Kendall score.
  - Implemented customer segmentation with GMM and spectral Clustering in Python with acceptable high accuracy.

- **Research Assistant**, Sharif Optimization and Applications Laboratory ([SOAL](http://soal.math.sharif.edu/)), Tehran, Iran (Jan 2022 - Jun 2022)
  - Implemented the **[Manifold Sampling](https://github.com/rahmani-hossein/Data-Synthesis)** Algorithm SUGAR for data generation for the OPTIMIZER competition held by SOAL laboratory in Multi-Manifold Clustering.
  - Developed a benchmark for multi-manifold clustering consisting of different algorithms like Hierarchical-Clustering, Spectral-Clustering, K-means, GMM, and density-based algorithms.
  - Implemented PCA and t-SNE for dimension reduction and visualization techniques for comparing clustering solutions on the data.

## Projects

- **[Bitcoin Question-Answering RAG](https://github.com/rahmani-hossein/RAG-System)**: A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for answering questions from Bitcoin articles using Chroma Vector Database, Sentence Transformer, Langchain, OpenAI GPT-4, and Tavily LLM Search agent.

- **[Spam Detection](https://github.com/rahmani-hossein/Spam-Detection)**: Implemented spam detection using Tree-based Methods (Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost) and compared their solutions on a [spam dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/94/spambase).

- **[Recommendation System](https://github.com/rahmani-hossein/VMLS-Companions)**: Developed a Recommendation System for foods using the ALS (Alternating Least Squares) method for matrix factorization implemented in Julia.

- **[HearthStone](https://github.com/rahmani-hossein/HearthStone)**: Implemented a Graphical Client-Server HearthStone game as a final project for the Advanced Programming course, utilizing multiple design patterns (SOLID principles, Factory, and Visitor).
