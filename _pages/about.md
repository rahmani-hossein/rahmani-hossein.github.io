I am joining TD Bank as an Applied ML Scientist 1 on the Personal Banking team. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Causal Machine Learning** and **Generative AI**, focusing on building interpretable AI systems that understand cause-and-effect relationships rather than mere correlations.

I recently completed my Master's in Applied Mathematics at UBC, specializing in Causal Inference and Optimal Transport methods.

## Education

**Master's in Applied Mathematics**, University of British Columbia (2023 - 2025) · GPA: 4.0/4.0
Thesis: [*Identifying drift, diffusion, and causal structure from temporal snapshots*](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0450482)
   First comprehensive approach for jointly estimating drift, diffusion, and causal structure of SDEs from temporal marginals using entropic optimal transport.

**Bachelor's in Computer Science**, Sharif University of Technology (2019 - 2023) · GPA: 4.0/4.0
Foundation in algorithms, probability, statistical learning, and software engineering with perfect grades in core courses.

## Research & Industry Experience

**Applied ML Scientist 1** at TD Bank (Nov 2025 - Present)
Developing machine learning solutions for personal banking applications, focusing on causal inference and generative AI for financial services.

**Research on LLM Attribution** with [Prof. Mathias Lecuyer](https://mathias.lecuyer.me), UBC (Sep 2024 - Present)
Designed a randomized experiment framework to measure the causal attribution of prompt words on Large Language Model outputs, estimating Average Marginal Effects (AME) of individual tokens.

**Master's Research** with [Prof. Elina Robeva](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~erobeva/index.html), UBC (Sep 2023 - Present)
Developed APPEX, an iterative algorithm using Optimal Transport to jointly estimate drift, diffusion, and causal graphs from temporal snapshots of Stochastic Differential Equations. [Preprint on arXiv](/publication/2024-10-30-appex), submitted to JMLR.

**Data Scientist** at [Shomara](https://www.linkedin.com/company/shomara/about/) (Dec 2021 - Oct 2022)
Applied causal inference in fintech: Estimated Conditional Average Treatment Effects using GRF with novel experimental designs and CUPED variance reduction. Improved default prediction models using XGBoost, achieving 5% relative AUC increase.

**Data Science Intern** at [Snapp Market](https://www.linkedin.com/company/snappmarket/) (Sep 2021 - Dec 2021)
Developed computer vision algorithm improving staff location tracking by 20% using YOLO and OpenCV. Built SQL-based marketing dashboards for business intelligence.
